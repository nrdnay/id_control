A company wants to set a unique ID number for its employees.

This ID number is required to consist of only characters A-Z, a-z and 0-9.

It must contain at least 2 capital letters.

It must contain at least 3 numbers.

No characters must be repeated.

The number of characters must be 10.

We are asked to create a system that will check ID numbers with this feature.

According to the scenario, each department manager will first enter the number of employees in his team into the system. And he will be allowed to enter only the number of ID numbers he entered.

The system will output the number of people in the team and Valid for correct ID numbers and Invalid for incorrect ID numbers.
