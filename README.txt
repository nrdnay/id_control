# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A company wants to set a unique ID number for its employees.

*****This ID number is required to consist of only characters A-Z, a-z and 0-9.

*****It must contain at least 2 capital letters.

*****It must contain at least 3 numbers.

*****No characters must be repeated.

*****The number of characters must be 10.

We are asked to create a system that will check ID numbers with these features.

According to this scenario, each department manager will first enter the number of employees in his team into the system. He will be allowed to enter the number of ID numbers he entered.

The system output will be "Valid" for correct ID numbers and "Invalid" for incorrect ID numbers.
